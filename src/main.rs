//! # Advent of Code 2021
//!
//! ## About
//!
//! [**Advent of Code**](https://adventofcode.com/) is an Advent calendar of
//! small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that
//! can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a
//! speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework,
//! practice problems, or to challenge each other.
//!
//! You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little
//! programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty
//! far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that
//! completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.
